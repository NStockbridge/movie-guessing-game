//        The rules are simple, the computer randomly picks a movie title, and 
//        shows you how many letters it's made up of. Your goal is to try to 
//        figure out the movie by guessing one letter at a time. If a letter is 
//        indeed in the title the computer will reveal its correct position in 
//        the word, if not, you lose a point. If you lose 10 points, game over!
//        BUT the more correct letters you guess the more obvious the movie 
//        becomes and at a certain point you should be able to figure it out.
//        The program will randomly pick a movie title from a text file that 
//        contains a large list of movies. You can download a sample text file  
//        to play with from the resources tab or create your own list of movie 
//        titles. Once the computer picks a random title, it will display 
//        underscores _ in place of the real letters, in the process only giving away 
//        the number of letters in the movie title.
